NID Image to NID Data Extraction:

Pseudocode:
1. Keep all the JPEG images of NID (back-side) in a specific folder in your computer

2. Create an empty list of string, say encoded_string to keep all the encoded string values (base64) of those NID images

3. For time efficieny, iterate over (using a 'for' loop) all the image files in that folder:

	4. Get the encoded string values (base64) from images one by one
	5. In the same time, insert the encoded string values one by one (using the 'extend' function) in the empty list of string values (encoded_string) created earlier

6. Create an API (say, in Postman) where we can make "call" and get NID information from the encoded string values of NID images
   [Creating a post request at Postman]

7. Fetch the list (encoded_string) of encoded string values of NID images into the request's body 
  #For time efficiency, we are fetching all the encoded string values instead of a single one

8. Send the request to the specific server
   #We will be needing VPN Connection

9. Server will extract data for each and every encoded string value inserted through a list in step 7 

10. Save this data into another text file for later use
