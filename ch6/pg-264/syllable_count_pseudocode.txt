Pseudocode to determine the number of syllables in the text:

1. First, break down the text into list of words through split function

2. Set count to zero

3. Define a function total_syllables with a single parameter (words) that return the syllable count for the list of words

4. In the function body insert a FOR loop to iterate over each item in the words list

5. Insert the IF keyword and if any word has less than equals to 3 words (check this from len (words [i]) <= ), assume that it has only 1 syllable and set count=count+1

6. ELIF len (words[i])<=5: it has 2 syllables and count= count+2

7. ELIF len (words[i])<=8: it has 3 syllables and count= count+3

8. ELIF len (words[i])<=11: it has 4 syllables and count= count+4

9. ELSE: count=count+5

10. RETURN the count to the function total_syllable

11. Print the total number of syllables.
